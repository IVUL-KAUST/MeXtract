        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present NEREL (Named Entities and RELations), a new Russian dataset with annotated named entities and relations. In developing the annotation schema, we aimed to accommodate recent advances in information extraction methods and datasets. Its important difference from previous datasets is annotation of nested named entities, as well as relations within nested entities and at the discourse level. NEREL can facilitate development of novel models that can extract relations between nested named entities, as well as relations on both sentence and document levels. NEREL also contains the annotation of events involving named entities and their roles in the events. The NEREL collection is available via https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL."
