        "Abstract": "We describe an Arabic-Hebrew parallel corpus of TED talks built upon WIT3, the Web inventory that repurposes the original content of the TED website in a way which is more convenient for MT researchers. Despite almost all English subtitles of TED talks have been translated into both Arabic and Hebrew, no IWSLT evaluation campaign proposed Arabic-Hebrew as an MT task. Actually, early releases of WIT3 distributed train data for hundreds of pairs, including Arabic-Hebrew. Nevertheless, those linguistic resources were prepared by means of a totally automatic procedure, with only rough sanity checks, and include talks available at that time. Given the increasing interest in the Arabic-Hebrew task and the many more TED talks translated into the two languages available to date, we decided to prepare a benchmark for Arabic-Hebrew. We exploited WIT3 for collecting raw data; moreover, for making the dissemination of results easier to users, we borrowed the partition of TED talks into train, development and test sets adopted in the IWSLT 2016 evaluation campaign."
