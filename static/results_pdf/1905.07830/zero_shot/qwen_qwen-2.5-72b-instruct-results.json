        "Abstract": "A woman is outside with a bucket and a dog. The dog is running around trying to avoid a bath. She... A. rinses the bucket off with soap and blow dry the dog\u2019s head. Recent work by Zellers et al. (2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural language inference: given an event description such as \u201cA woman sits at a piano,\u201d a machine must select the most likely followup: \u201cShe sets her fingers on the keys.\u201d With the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), near-human level performance was reached. However, this paper shows that commonsense inference remains difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset."
