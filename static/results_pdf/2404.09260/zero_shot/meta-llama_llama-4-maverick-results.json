        "Abstract": "We construct an instruction dataset for the large language model (LLM) in the Japanese finance domain. Domain adaptation of language models, including LLMs, is receiving more attention as language models become more popular. Finance is mentioned as one of the domain adaptations. In the financial domain, various NLP tasks, such as information extraction, summarization, and classification, are used in financial practice and are in high demand."
