Talks have beennpartitioned in train, development and test sets similarly in allnrespects to the MT tasks of the IWSLT 2016 evaluation campaign.nnIn addition to describing the benchmark, we list the problemsnencountered in preparing it and the novel methods designed to solventhem. Baseline MT results and some measures on sentence length arenprovided as an extrinsic evaluation of the quality of the benchmark."
