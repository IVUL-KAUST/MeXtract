        "Abstract": "This paper describes the Arabic MGB-3 Challenge -- Arabic Speech Recognition in the Wild. The data was distributed to more than 20 teams, out of which 13 teams submitted 10 systems to the challenge for the ASR and ADI tasks. We attempt to highlight key features of the systems below. Detailed submitted system descriptions are cited and can be found on the MGB portal. In this task, participants were asked to label each sentence with one dialect. We received five submissions from eight teams. Similar to the ASR task, participants submitted one primary submission and as many contrastive submissions as they wished."
