        "Abstract": "This paper presents our efforts on automatic dialect identification for Arabic broadcast speech. We have demonstrated a dialect classifier with an accuracy of 60.2% using system combination. We also achieved 100% accuracy on two binary classification tasks; MSA vs Dialectal Arabic and English vs Arabic. We studied the potential code-switching pattern in our classifier and its correlation with the manual annotation. Further work for this research is to study the code-switch between MSA and dialectal Arabic without considering speaker diarization or silence between speech segments in what can be called dialect diarization. We shall also study deep neural network approaches of classification to learn a more complex non-linear decision boundary."
