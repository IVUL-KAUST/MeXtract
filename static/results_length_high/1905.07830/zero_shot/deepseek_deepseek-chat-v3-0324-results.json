        "Abstract": "HellaSwag is a new dataset for commonsense natural language inference, designed to be challenging for state-of-the-art models. The dataset is constructed using Adversarial Filtering, which selects machine-generated wrong answers that are difficult for models to distinguish from human-written correct answers. The dataset is easy for humans (95.6% accuracy) but challenging for machines (<50% accuracy), even when models are trained on the same distribution as the test set. The dataset is derived from ActivityNet captions and WikiHow articles, and is intended for tasks such as natural language inference."
