        "Abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a key component of many natural language processing pipelines. However, most NER systems are developed for English and a few other resource-rich languages. We present Polyglot-NER, a named entity recognition system capable of identifying entities in 40 languages. We achieve this by training a single sequence labeling model jointly on multiple languages using multilingual word embeddings. Our system leverages large amounts of unlabeled data from Wikipedia and Freebase to learn cross-lingual representations. We evaluate our system on standard NER benchmarks for several languages and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in many cases, especially for resource-poor languages. We release our models and code to facilitate research in multilingual NER."
