        "Abstract": "Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce fullname{} (name{}), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. name{} consists of questioncount{} questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. name{} is developed by academics and domain experts, providing a precise measure of capabilities as LLMs continue to improve. We publicly release name{} at https://lastexam.ai."
