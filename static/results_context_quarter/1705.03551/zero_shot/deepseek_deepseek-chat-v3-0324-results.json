        "Abstract": "This paper presents TriviaQA, a new reading comprehension dataset designed to test complex reasoning and understanding from multiple sentences. The dataset contains over 650K question-answer-evidence triples, with questions authored by trivia enthusiasts and evidence documents collected retrospectively from Wikipedia and the web. The dataset is challenging, with a high percentage of questions requiring multi-sentence reasoning and exhibiting substantial syntactic and lexical variability. Baseline experiments show a significant gap between state-of-the-art methods and human performance, suggesting room for future work."
