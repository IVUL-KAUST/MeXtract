        "Abstract": "Reading comprehension (RC) systems aim to answer any question that could be posed against the facts in some reference text. This goal is challenging for a number of reasons: (1) the questions can be complex (e.g. have highly compositional semantics), (2) finding the correct answer can require complex reasoning (e.g. combining facts from multiple sentences or background knowledge) and (3) individual facts can be difficult to recover from text (e.g. due to lexical and syntactic variation). This paper presents TriviaQA, a new reading comprehension dataset designed to simultaneously test all of these challenges."
