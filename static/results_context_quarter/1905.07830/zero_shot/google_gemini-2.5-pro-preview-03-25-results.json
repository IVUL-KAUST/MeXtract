        "Abstract": "Though current language models can generate fluent text, it is unclear whether they can 'reason' in a commonsense way like humans. For example, given the context 'He opened the door and walked into the room,' a human can infer that 'He is now in the room.' However, can a machine do the same? We introduce HellaSwag, a new dataset for commonsense NLI. HellaSwag consists of 70k multiple choice questions about physically-grounded situations. Each question is composed of a context, and 4 endings -- only one of which is correct. The contexts are sourced from ActivityNet Captions and WikiHow; the correct endings are the next event in the video/article. The incorrect endings are adversarially generated by a novel procedure we call Adversarial Filtering (AF), then verified by humans. We show that while humans find HellaSwag easy (95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (BERT-Large: 48%; GPT: 42%). We hope that HellaSwag will serve as a challenging benchmark for future research in commonsense NLI."
