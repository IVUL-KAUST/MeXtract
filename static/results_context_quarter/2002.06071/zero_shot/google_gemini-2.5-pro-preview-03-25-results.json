        "Abstract": "We present FQuAD, a native French Question Answering dataset. The dataset consists of 25k question-answer pairs on a set of 1k Wikipedia articles. The questions and answers were written by native French speakers. The dataset was created by professional translators, who were asked to translate the original SQuAD dataset and then to create new question-answer pairs based on the translated context. We also present a French Question Answering model based on CamemBERT that achieves state-of-the-art results on FQuAD. The dataset is publicly available at https://fquad.illuin.tech/"
