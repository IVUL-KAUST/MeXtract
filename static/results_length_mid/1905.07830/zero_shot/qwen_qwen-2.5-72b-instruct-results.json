        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present HellaSwag, a new dataset for commonsense natural language inference. Despite being trivial for humans (>95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (<48% accuracy). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm that iteratively selects an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. This dataset highlights the limitations of current deep pretrained models and suggests a path forward for NLP research, where benchmarks co-evolve with the evolving state-of-the-art."
