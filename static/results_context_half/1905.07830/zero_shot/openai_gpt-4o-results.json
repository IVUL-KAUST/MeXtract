        "Abstract": "In this paper, we presented HellaSwag, a new dataset for physically situated commonsense reasoning. By constructing the dataset through adversarial filtering, combined with state-of-the-art models for language generation and discrimination, we produced a dataset that is adversarial to the most robust models available -- even when models are evaluated on items from the training distribution. In turn, we provided insight into the inner workings of pretrained models, and suggest a path for NLP progress going forward: towards benchmarks that adversarially co-evolve with evolving state-of-the-art models."
