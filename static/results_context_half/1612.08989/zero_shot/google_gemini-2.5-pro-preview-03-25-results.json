        "Abstract": "The Al-Maktaba Al-Shamela (Shamela) corpus is the largest collection of Arabic texts, containing over 800 million words from all periods of the Arabic language. In this paper, we describe our work on preparing this corpus for research in historical linguistics and digital humanities. We discuss the challenges of working with such a large and diverse collection of texts, including metadata wrangling, text reuse detection, and automatic text dating. We also present some initial findings from our analysis of the corpus, such as the lifespan of Arabic words and the evolution of genres over time. Finally, we announce the public release of the lemmatized version of the corpus, which we hope will be a valuable resource for the research community."
