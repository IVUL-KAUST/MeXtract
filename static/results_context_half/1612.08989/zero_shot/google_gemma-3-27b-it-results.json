        "Abstract": "A major desideratum in approaching this corpus is being able to detect, and potentially eliminate duplicate and reused text segments. Quotation of extensive sections of material is common in the Islamicate literary tradition, but unlike modern quotation it is not distinguished from the text at large. Identification of reused text is valuable for computational linguistic work, and for DH projects. We formulate our dating problem as a ranking task. Given an undated text, we would like to generate a ranked list of candidate dates. This formulation can facilitate subsequent manual inspection of the texts. It can also be useful for language technology applications that require an approximate date. Al-Maktaba Al-Shamela (``The Complete Library'') is a website which collects and stores digitized copies of important texts from throughout the history of the Arabic language. Sponsored by a religious charity, the texts are largely religious in nature, though there was not a strong division between religious and secular texts in the pre-modern era, and so many of the pre-modern texts are simply part of the Islamicate intellectual and literary tradition."
