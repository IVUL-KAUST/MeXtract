        "Abstract": "The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) is a benchmark for commonsense reasoning. Recent advances in neural language models have reached around 90% accuracy on variants of WSC, raising questions about whether these models have truly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or rely on spurious biases. We introduce WinoGrande, a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design but adjusted to improve scale and hardness. The best state-of-the-art methods achieve 59.4 - 79.1% accuracy, 15-35% below human performance. We establish new state-of-the-art results on five related benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of WinoGrande for transfer learning."
