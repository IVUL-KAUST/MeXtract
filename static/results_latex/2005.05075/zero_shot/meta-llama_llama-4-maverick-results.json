        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a mainly French coronavirus Twitter dataset that we have been continuously collecting since lockdown restrictions have been enacted in France (in March 17, 2020). We offer our datasets and sentiment analysis annotations to the research community at https://github.com/calciu/COVID19-LockdownFr. They have been obtained using high performance computing (HPC) capabilities of our university's datacenter. We think that our contribution can facilitate analysis of online conversation dynamics reflecting people sentiments when facing severe home confinement restrictions determined by the outbreak of this world wide epidemic."
