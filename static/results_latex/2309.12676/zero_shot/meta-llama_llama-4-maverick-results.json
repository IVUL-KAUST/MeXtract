        "Abstract": "This paper introduces JCoLA, a Japanese Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability, consisting of 10,020 sentences annotated with binary acceptability judgments. The sentences are manually extracted from linguistics textbooks, handbooks, and journal articles, and are split into in-domain and out-of-domain data. The results of evaluating 9 different Japanese language models on JCoLA demonstrate that while several models surpass human performance on in-domain data, none exceed human performance on out-of-domain data."
