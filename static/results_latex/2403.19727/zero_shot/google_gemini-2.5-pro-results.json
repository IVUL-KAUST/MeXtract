        "Abstract": "Intent classification and slot-filling are essential tasks of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). In most SLU systems, those tasks are realized by independent modules. For about fifteen years, models achieving both of them jointly and exploiting their mutual enhancement have been proposed. A multilingual module using a joint modelwasenvisionedtocreateatouristicdialoguesystemforaEuropeanproject,HumanE-AI-Net. Acombination of multiple datasets, includingthe MEDIA dataset, was suggested for training this joint model. The MEDIA SLU datasetisa Frenchdatasetdistributedsince2005byELRA,mainlyusedbytheFrenchresearchcommunityand free for academic research since 2020. Unfortunately,it is annotatedonly in slots but not intents. An enhanced version of MEDIA annotated with intents has been built to extend its use to more tasks and use cases. This paper presents the semi-automatic methodology used to obtain this enhanced version. In addition, we present thefirstresultsofSLUexperimentsonthisenhanceddatasetusingjointmodelsforintentclassificationandslot-filling."
