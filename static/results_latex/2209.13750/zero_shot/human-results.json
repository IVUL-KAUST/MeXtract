        "Abstract": "We present RuDSI, a new benchmark for word sense induction (WSI) in Russian. The dataset was created using manual annotation and semi-automatic clustering of Word Usage Graphs (WUGs). Unlike prior WSI datasets for Russian, RuDSI is completely data-driven (based on texts from Russian National Corpus), with no external word senses imposed on annotators. Depending on the parameters of graph clustering, different derivative datasets can be produced from raw annotation. We report the performance that several baseline WSI methods obtain on RuDSI and discuss possibilities for improving these scores.",
