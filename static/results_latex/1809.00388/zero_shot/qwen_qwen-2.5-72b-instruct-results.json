        "Abstract": "Noisy or non-standard input text can cause disastrous mistranslations in most modern MT systems, and there has been growing research interest in creating noise-robust MT systems. However, as of yet there are no publicly available parallel corpora of with naturally occurring noisy inputs and translations, and thus previous work has resorted to evaluating on synthetically created datasets. In this paper, we propose a benchmark dataset for MTNT, consisting of noisy comments on Reddit and professionally sourced translations."
