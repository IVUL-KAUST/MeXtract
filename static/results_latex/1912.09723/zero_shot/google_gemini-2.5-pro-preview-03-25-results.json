        "Description": "SberQuAD is a large-scale Russian reading comprehension dataset, analogous to the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). It contains over 50,000 question-answer pairs based on paragraphs from Russian Wikipedia. The dataset was created by crowdworkers who formulated questions for given paragraphs, with the answer being a contiguous span of text from the paragraph. It was originally developed for a question answering competition hosted by Sberbank.",
