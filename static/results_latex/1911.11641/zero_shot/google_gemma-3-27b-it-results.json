        "Abstract": "To apply eyeshadow without a brush, should I use a textit{cotton swab or a toothpick}? Questions requiring this kind of  textbf{physical commonsense} pose a challenge to today's natural language understanding systems. While recent pretrained models (such as BERT) have made progress on question answering over more emph{abstract} domains -- such as news articles and encyclopedia entries, where text is plentiful -- in more emph{physical} domains, text is inherently limited due to reporting bias. nCan AI systems learn to reliably answer physical commonsense questions without experiencing the physical world?nnIn this paper, we introduce the task of physical commonsense reasoning and a corresponding benchmark dataset datasetlong{} or dataset{} pig{}. Though humans find the dataset easy (95% accuracy), large pretrained models struggle ($sim$77%). We provide analysis about the dimensions of knowledge that existing models lack, which offers significant opportunities for future research."
