        "Abstract": "HellaSwag is a new dataset for commonsense natural language inference, designed to be challenging for state-of-the-art models while easy for humans. The dataset is constructed using Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models."
