It uses Adversarial Filtering to select machine-generated wrong answers that are difficult for models to distinguish from correct answers.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the following question: How well do deep pretrained models, like BERT, perform at commonsense natural language inference (NLI)? Our surprising conclusion is that the underlying task remains unsolved. We introduce HellaSwag, a new benchmark for commonsense NLI, which is easy for humans (>95% accuracy) but challenging for machines (<48% accuracy)."
