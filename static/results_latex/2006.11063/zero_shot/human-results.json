The paper describes the dataset's properties and benchmarks several extractive and abstractive models, demonstrating that a pretrained mBART model is particularly effective for this task.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic text summarization has been studied in a variety of domains and languages. However, this does not hold for the Russian language. To overcome this issue, we present Gazeta, the first dataset for summarization of Russian news. We describe the properties of this dataset and benchmark several extractive and abstractive models. We demonstrate that the dataset is a valid task for methods of text summarization for Russian. Additionally, we prove the pretrained mBART model to be useful for Russian text summarization.",
