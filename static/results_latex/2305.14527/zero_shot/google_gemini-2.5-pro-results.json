This paper presents the Russian Sign Language (RSL) video dataset Slovo, produced using crowdsourcing platforms.Thedatasetcontains20,000FullHDrecordings,dividedinto1,000 classesofisolatedRSLgesturesreceivedby194signers.Wealsoprovide the entire dataset creation pipeline, from data collection to video annotation,withthefollowingdemoapplication.Severalneuralnetworksare trained and evaluated on the Slovo to demonstrate its teaching ability. Proposed data and pre-trained models are publicly available."
