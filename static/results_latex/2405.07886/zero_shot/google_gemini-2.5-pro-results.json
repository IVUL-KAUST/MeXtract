        "Abstract": "The paper discusses the creation of a multimodal dataset of Russian-language scientific papers and testing of existing language models for the task of automatic text summarization. A feature of the dataset is its multimodal data, which includes texts, tables and figures. The paper presents the results of experiments with two language models: Gigachat from SBER and YandexGPT from Yandex. The dataset consists of 420 papers and is publicly available on https://github.com/iis-research-team/summarization-dataset."
