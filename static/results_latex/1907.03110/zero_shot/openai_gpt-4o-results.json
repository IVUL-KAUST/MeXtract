        "Abstract": "In this paper, we make freely accessible ANETAC our English-Arabic named entity transliteration and classification dataset that we built from freely available parallel translation corpora. The dataset contains 79,924 instances, each instance is a triplet (e, a, c), where e is the English named entity, a is its Arabic transliteration and c is its class that can be either a Person, a Location, or an Organization. The ANETAC dataset is mainly aimed for the researchers that are working on Arabic named entity transliteration, but it can also be used for named entity classification purposes. This dataset was developed and used as part of a previous research study done by Hadj Ameur et al."
