        "Abstract": "Thanks to improvements in machine learning techniques including deep learning, a free large-scale speech corpus that\ncan be shared between academic institutions and commercial\ncompanies has an important role. However, such a corpus for\nJapanese speech synthesis does not exist. In this paper, we\ndesigned a novel Japanese speech corpus, named the \u201cJSUT\ncorpus,\u201d that is aimed at achieving end-to-end speech synthesis. The corpus consists of 10 hours of reading-style speech\ndata and its transcription and covers all of the main pronunciations of daily-use Japanese characters. In this paper, we\ndescribe how we designed and analyzed the corpus. The corpus is freely available online",
