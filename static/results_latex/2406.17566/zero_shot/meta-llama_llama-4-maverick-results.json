        "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are prone to generating bias, toxic or harmful language. This paper creates and releases FrenchToxicityPrompts, a dataset of 50K naturally occurring French prompts and their continuations, annotated with toxicity scores from a widely used toxicity classifier. The dataset is used to evaluate 14 different models from four prevalent open-sourced families of LLMs against the dataset to assess their potential toxicity across various dimensions."
