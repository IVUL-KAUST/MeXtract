        "Abstract": "Information retrieval is a widely employed technology that assists users in locating relevant information from extensive corpora. While existing benchmarks primarily focus on fact-based queries, many real-world scenarios involve complex queries where relevance is not determined by simple keyword or semantic matching but requires intensive reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce BRIGHT, a new benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval. BRIGHT consists of 12 datasets from diverse and advanced domains, including StackExchange, coding, and mathematics. These datasets are constructed from naturally occurring human data and curated sources, with relevance validated by human annotators. We evaluate 13 representative retrieval models and find that even the best-performing models struggle on BRIGHT, with the top model achieving an nDCG@10 score of only 24.3. We explore methods to improve performance, such as using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate chain-of-thought reasoning steps for queries, which shows significant gains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong retrieval on BRIGHT can significantly enhance downstream reasoning tasks. Our benchmark is designed to be robust against data leakage from pre-training and aims to foster future research in reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our data and code are available at https://brightbenchmark.github.io/."
