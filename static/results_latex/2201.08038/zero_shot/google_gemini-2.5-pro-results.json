The dataset consists of source texts from Japanese language learners (from TEC-JL and FLUTEC corpora), corrected texts generated by four different GEC systems (SMT, RNN, CNN, Transformer), and manual evaluation scores on a 5-point Likert scale provided by native Japanese speakers.",

        "Abstract": "In grammatical error correction (GEC), automatic evaluation is an important factor for research and development of GEC systems. Previous studies on automatic evaluation have demonstrated that quality estimation models built from datasets with manual evaluation can achieve high performance in automatic evaluation of English GEC without using reference sentences. However, quality estimation models have not yet been studied in Japanese, because there are no datasets for constructing quality estimation models. Therefore, in this study, we created a quality estimation dataset with manual evaluation to build an automatic evaluation model for Japanese GEC. Moreover, we conducted a meta-evaluation to verify the dataset's usefulness in building the Japanese quality estimation model."
