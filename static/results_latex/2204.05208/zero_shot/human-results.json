Fortunately,recentnaturallanguageprocessing(NLP)approaches allowforthedevelopmentofmethodstoautomaticallyextractinformationfromjobads and recognize skills more precisely. However, these efficient approaches need a large amount of annotated data from the studied domain which is difficult to access, mainly duetointellectualproperty. Thisarticleproposesanewpublicdataset,FIJO,containing insurancejoboffers,includingmanysoftskillannotations. Tounderstandthepotential of this dataset, we detail some characteristics and some limitations.
