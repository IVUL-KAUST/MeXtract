        "Abstract": "Understanding the evolution of job requirements is becoming more important for workers, companies and public organizations to follow the fast transformation of the employmentmarket. Fortunately,recentnaturallanguageprocessing(NLP)approaches allowforthedevelopmentofmethodstoautomaticallyextractinformationfromjobads and recognize skills more precisely. However, these efficient approaches need a large amount of annotated data from the studied domain which is difficult to access, mainly duetointellectualproperty. Thisarticleproposesanewpublicdataset,FIJO,containing insurancejoboffers,includingmanysoftskillannotations. Tounderstandthepotential of this dataset, we detail some characteristics and some limitations. Then, we present the results of skill detection algorithms using a named entity recognition approach and showthattransformers-basedmodelshavegoodtoken-wiseperformancesonthisdataset.
