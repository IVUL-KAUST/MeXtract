        "Abstract": "Lexical complexity is an important factor in reading comprehension for non-native readers. While there are several datasets for lexical complexity in English, there are few such datasets for Japanese. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for Japanese lexical complexity, in which words in sentences from the Japanese Wikipedia are annotated by non-native Japanese learners on a 5-point scale. We call this dataset JLC (Japanese Lexical Complexity) and show that it is a high-quality dataset through a pilot study and data analysis. We also build a baseline model for predicting the complexity of Japanese words for non-native readers and show that the model achieves a certain level of performance. The dataset is publicly available."
