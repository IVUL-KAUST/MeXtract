        "Abstract": "Existing question answering (QA) datasets fail to train QA systems to perform complex reasoning and provide explanations for answers. We introduce HotpotQA, a new dataset with 113k Wikipedia-based question-answer pairs that are diverse and require finding and reasoning over multiple supporting documents to answer. HotpotQA is also the first QA dataset that provides sentence-level supporting facts required for reasoning, allowing QA systems to reason with strong supervision and explain the predictions. We show that the state-of-the-art QA models perform poorly on HotpotQA, and the task is still challenging. We have released our dataset and a public leaderboard to encourage future research."
