        "Abstract": "This paper presents a new semantic task for the French spoken language understanding MEDIA benchmark. The MEDIA corpus is composed of human-machine dialogs in the domain of hotel reservation and tourist information. The original evaluation campaign, which took place in 2005, was focused on the extraction of a final frame containing all the information provided by the user during the dialog. We propose a new task based on semantic slot filling which aims at extracting finer-grained information. This task is based on a new annotation of the MEDIA corpus which is focused on temporal expressions and named entities. This paper describes the annotation protocol and presents some characteristics of the resulting annotated corpus. The MEDIA corpus, including the new annotations, is distributed by ELRA (European Language Resources Association) with the reference ELRA-S0258."
