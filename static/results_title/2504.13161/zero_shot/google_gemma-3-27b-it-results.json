        "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance heavily relies on the quality and scale of pre-training data. Existing datasets often suffer from issues like data contamination, redundancy, and lack of diversity. To address these challenges, we propose CLIMB, a CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping approach for constructing high-quality pre-training datasets. CLIMB iteratively clusters web pages based on their content, selects representative samples from each cluster, and bootstraps a diverse and informative dataset. We evaluate CLIMB on various language modeling benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of LLMs. CLIMB is a large-scale, multilingual dataset containing 300B tokens, and we release the dataset and code to facilitate future research."
