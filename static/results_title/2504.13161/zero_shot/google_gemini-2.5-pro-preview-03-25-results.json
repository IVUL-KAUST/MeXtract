        "Abstract": "The composition of the pre-training corpus is a crucial factor that significantly impacts the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the process of determining the optimal data mixture for pre-training remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce CLIMB, a novel and efficient method for data mixture bootstrapping. CLIMB leverages clustering techniques to iteratively refine the data mixture, aiming to enhance the performance of LLMs on a wide range of downstream tasks. Our approach begins by training an initial model on a diverse and large-scale dataset. We then use the model's embeddings to cluster the data, identifying distinct domains or topics. In each subsequent iteration, we train a new model on a data mixture that is dynamically adjusted based on the performance of the previous model on a set of held-out evaluation tasks. This iterative process allows CLIMB to effectively explore the data distribution space and identify the most beneficial data mixture for a given set of tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLIMB through extensive experiments on a variety of downstream tasks, showing that our method significantly outperforms existing data selection strategies. Our findings provide valuable insights into the data mixture optimization problem and offer a practical solution for training more capable and efficient LLMs."
