        "Abstract": "We present JParaCrawl, a large-scale English-Japanese parallel corpus created by crawling the web. The corpus contains over 10 million sentence pairs, making it the largest publicly available English-Japanese parallel corpus, to the best of our knowledge. We built our corpus based on the ParaCrawl project, which has focused on building parallel corpora for European languages. We describe our crawling and text processing pipeline, which is specifically designed for English and Japanese. We also describe the process of filtering the crawled data to obtain a high-quality parallel corpus. We conducted a machine translation experiment to show the effectiveness of JParaCrawl. The results show that a neural machine translation model trained on JParaCrawl outperforms a model trained on a combination of existing English-Japanese parallel corpora. The corpus is publicly available at http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/jparacrawl/."
