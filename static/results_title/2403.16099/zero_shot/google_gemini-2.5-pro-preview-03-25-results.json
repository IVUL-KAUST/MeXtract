        "Abstract": "This paper presents a new dataset of French fake news, annotated with 10 labels that allow for a fine-grained analysis of the data. The dataset is composed of 1,110 news articles, balanced between fake and real news. The annotation process was conducted by two annotators, and we report a good inter-annotator agreement. We also present a detailed analysis of the dataset, both from a human and a machine perspective. We show that the labels are useful for distinguishing between fake and real news, and that they can be used to train a classifier that achieves good performance. We also show that the dataset is challenging for current state-of-the-art models, and that there is still room for improvement. The dataset is freely available for research purposes."
