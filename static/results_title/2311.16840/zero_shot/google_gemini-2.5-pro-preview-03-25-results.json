        "Abstract": "The quality and scale of training datasets are key for building powerful large language models. In this paper, we introduce Claire, a new large-scale dataset of high-quality French dialogues. The dataset consists of 173k dialogues generated by professional writers, covering a wide range of topics and tasks. Each dialogue turn is annotated with a quality rating, and a subset of the data is annotated with fine-grained error categories. We describe the data collection and annotation process, and we provide a detailed analysis of the dataset. We also train a 7B parameter language model on the dataset and show that it outperforms existing French models on a range of benchmarks. The dataset is released under the Apache 2.0 license, and we hope that it will be a valuable resource for the French NLP community."
