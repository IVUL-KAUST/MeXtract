        "Abstract": "We present SberQuAD, a new large-scale Russian reading comprehension dataset. It is inspired by SQuAD, a popular machine reading comprehension dataset for English. We crawled 5,000 articles from Russian Wikipedia and collected over 50,000 questions. The dataset was collected and annotated by humans on the crowdsourcing platform Yandex.Toloka. We provide a detailed description of the data collection and annotation methodology and analyze the main properties of the resulting dataset. We also present several baseline models, including a strong multilingual neural model, and compare their performance with human accuracy. The dataset is publicly available. We hope that SberQuAD will foster the research in Russian machine reading comprehension."
