        "Abstract": "We introduce a large-scale reading comprehension dataset, RACE, consisting of nearly 100,000 questions in the style of English exams for Chinese middle and high school students. The questions require multi-step reasoning to answer, and the dataset is challenging for existing machine reading comprehension models. We present a two-stage model that combines a memory network with a bidirectional attention flow to achieve state-of-the-art results on RACE. Our model outperforms previous methods by a significant margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."
