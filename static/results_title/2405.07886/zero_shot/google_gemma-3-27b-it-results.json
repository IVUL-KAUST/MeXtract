        "Abstract": "Automatic summarization is a crucial task in the age of information overload. While significant progress has been made in English summarization, Russian summarization remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we present RuSum, a new Russian-language multimodal dataset for automatic summarization of scientific papers. The dataset consists of 1,122 scientific papers with abstracts in Russian, covering a wide range of scientific domains. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including statistics on document length, abstract length, and vocabulary size. We also present baseline results on the dataset using several state-of-the-art summarization models. Our results demonstrate that RuSum is a challenging and valuable resource for Russian summarization research."
