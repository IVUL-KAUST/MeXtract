        "Abstract": "Automatic summarization of scientific papers is a popular and challenging task. Most of the existing datasets for this task are for English and Chinese languages. In this paper, we present the first Russian-language multimodal dataset for automatic summarization of scientific papers (Ru-Title-Abs-Fig). The dataset consists of pairs of a scientific paper and its summary. The paper is represented by its title, abstract, and figures, while the summary is represented by the paper's title. The dataset is based on scientific papers from the arXiv.org preprint archive. The final dataset consists of 27,000 pairs of a paper and its summary. We also present several strong baselines for the task of title generation. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub."
