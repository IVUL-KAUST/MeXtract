        "Abstract": "Question answering is a major focus of NLP research. However, existing datasets are either small in scale or created using artificial processes such as crowdsourcing or dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a new question answering dataset, BOOLQ, containing 15,942 examples. These are naturally occurring questions, generated in an unconstrained setting. Each example is a triplet of (question, passage, answer), with the passage sourced from a Wikipedia article. We explore the surprising difficulty of this new dataset, as BERT-based models only achieve around 80% accuracy, which is well below human performance (94%). We also show that transfer learning from other QA datasets does not improve performance. Finally, we perform a detailed linguistic analysis of our dataset and show that it contains a rich variety of challenging phenomena that are not well-represented in existing datasets."
