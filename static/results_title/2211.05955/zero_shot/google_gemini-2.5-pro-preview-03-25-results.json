        "Abstract": "Event extraction (EE) aims to extract structured event information from unstructured texts, which is a crucial task in information extraction. However, most existing EE datasets are in English, which hinders the development of multilingual EE. In this paper, we introduce MEE, a new multilingual EE dataset with 10,000/2,000 sentences for English/Chinese respectively. We first define a uniform and fine-grained event schema for both languages. Then we propose a cost-effective method to construct the dataset. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MEE to provide benchmarks for future works. The experimental results show that MEE is a challenging dataset for state-of-the-art models. We will release our dataset and codes to promote the research of multilingual EE."
