        "Abstract": "We present DiS-ReX, a multilingual dataset for distantly supervised relation extraction. DiS-ReX has been created by aligning relations from Wikidata with text from Wikipedia in two languages - English and German. It contains over 2.5M sentences and 5M relation instances for 1,201 relations. We also release our code for dataset creation, which can be used to create DiS-ReX in any of the 100+ languages available in Wikipedia. We create DiS-ReX by improving upon the existing alignment methods, and show that our method extracts 2.5x more relation instances than the previous state-of-the-art method. We also create distant supervision benchmarks for evaluating relation extraction systems. We find that the models trained on DiS-ReX perform better than the models trained on previous datasets. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/bhartiya-yash/DiS-ReX."
