        "Abstract": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has brought with it the challenge of ensuring their outputs are safe and non-toxic. While significant progress has been made for English, other languages, including French, have received less attention. In this paper, we introduce FrenchToxicityPrompts, a new, large-scale, and high-quality dataset of 100k prompts in French, designed to evaluate and mitigate toxicity in French LLMs. Built upon the prompts from the RealToxicityPrompts English dataset, our benchmark has been carefully constructed through a multi-step process of translation, filtering, and generation of continuations using several French LLMs. We also provide toxicity scores for all generated texts, obtained through a combination of automated tools and human validation, ensuring a reliable and nuanced evaluation framework. We use this benchmark to conduct the first large-scale study of toxicity in French LLMs, assessing seven models, and exploring the effectiveness of detoxification methods like self-debiasing. Our results highlight the varying levels of toxicity among models and the challenges in mitigating it, paving the way for future research in developing safer and more reliable French LLMs. The dataset, models, and code are publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub."
