        "Abstract": "We present Slovo, a large-scale Russian Sign Language (RSL) video dataset. It contains 87,686 video clips of 750 different RSL signs performed by 16 signers. The dataset is recorded in a controlled environment with neutral background and consistent lighting. The videos are annotated with bounding box coordinates of the hands and face, as well as the corresponding RSL glosses. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including the distribution of signs, signers, and video characteristics. We also present baseline results for RSL recognition using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes."
