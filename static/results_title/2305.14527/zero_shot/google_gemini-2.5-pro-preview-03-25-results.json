        "Abstract": "Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a challenging task that has recently received a lot of attention from the research community. However, the progress in this area is hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce Slovo, a large-scale Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset. We have collected a large-scale dataset of isolated RSL signs, featuring more than 1,000 signers and over 200,000 video samples in total. The data was collected 'in the wild' using a crowdsourcing platform. The vocabulary of the dataset consists of 1,000 gestures. We provide a detailed description of the dataset and the collection process. We also present baseline results for the isolated sign language recognition task. The dataset is publicly available at https://rsl.sber.ai."
