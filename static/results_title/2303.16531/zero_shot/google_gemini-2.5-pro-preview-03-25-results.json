        "Abstract": "This paper introduces RusTitW (Russian Text in the Wild), a new publicly available dataset for text recognition in the wild. The dataset contains 33,533 images with more than 100,000 text instances, fully annotated on a word and line level. The images were collected in various conditions and contain a wide range of text types, including street signs, advertisements, and information plates. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, with 26,826 and 6,707 images, respectively. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art text recognition models. The dataset is available at https://github.com/SmartEngines/RusTitW."
