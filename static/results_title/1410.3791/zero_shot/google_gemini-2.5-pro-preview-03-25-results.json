        "Abstract": "We present a named entity recognition (NER) system that is trained on a large, diverse, and multilingual dataset that we created by leveraging Wikipedia and the Freebase knowledge base. Our models are not restricted to a small set of languages, but can be trained for any of the 100+ languages in Wikipedia. We created a new NER dataset in 40 languages. We use a neural network architecture with word embeddings to perform NER. Our system is lean, as it does not require any handcrafted features or language-specific resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating our models on 11 languages for which there are existing NER systems and publicly available datasets. We show that our models are competitive with the state-of-the-art in 8 of these languages. The data and the models are available at http://polyglot-nlp.com/."
