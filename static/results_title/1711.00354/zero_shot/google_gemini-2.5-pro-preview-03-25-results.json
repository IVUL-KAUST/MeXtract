        "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new Japanese speech corpus for end-to-end speech synthesis. Recently, many end-to-end speech synthesis systems, which can directly generate a speech waveform from a text, have been proposed. These systems require a large amount of speech and text pairs for training. Although some open-source English speech corpora are available, there are no publicly available Japanese speech corpora that are sufficiently large for this purpose. To address this problem, we have constructed a new Japanese speech corpus, which we call the 'Japanese speech corpus of versatile text for end-to-end speech synthesis (JSUT)'. This corpus is composed of approximately 10 hours of speech data from a single female speaker. The text data are sourced from various books and online text. This corpus is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license (CC BY-SA 4.0). We also provide a recipe for building a speech synthesis system based on the Tacotron model using this corpus."
