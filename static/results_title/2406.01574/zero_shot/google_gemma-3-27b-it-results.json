        "Abstract": "Massive multitask language understanding (MMLU) is a popular benchmark for evaluating the knowledge and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, MMLU suffers from several limitations, including a lack of robustness to adversarial examples and a limited diversity of questions. In this paper, we introduce MMLU-Pro, a more robust and challenging version of MMLU. MMLU-Pro is created by applying adversarial filtering to the original MMLU dataset, removing questions that are easily solved by LLMs. We also introduce a more diverse set of questions, covering a wider range of topics and difficulty levels. We show that MMLU-Pro is significantly more challenging than MMLU for LLMs, and that it is more robust to adversarial examples. We also demonstrate that MMLU-Pro is a better predictor of LLM performance on real-world tasks."
