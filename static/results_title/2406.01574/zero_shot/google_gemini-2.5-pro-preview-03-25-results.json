        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language understanding tasks. However, their performance on complex reasoning tasks remains a challenge. The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark has been widely used to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce MMLU-Pro, a more robust and challenging version of the MMLU benchmark. We identify and reformulate ambiguous questions from the original MMLU test set, resulting in a new benchmark that requires deeper knowledge and reasoning. Our experiments show that MMLU-Pro is more challenging for current state-of-the-art LLMs, with an average performance drop of over 10% compared to the original MMLU. We believe that MMLU-Pro will serve as a valuable resource for the community to develop and evaluate more capable LLMs. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/MMLU-Pro."
