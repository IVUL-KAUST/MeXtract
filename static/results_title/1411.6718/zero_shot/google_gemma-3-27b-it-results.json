        "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis (SA) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) with numerous real-world applications. While substantial progress has been made in English SA, Arabic SA remains relatively under-resourced, particularly in terms of large-scale, high-quality benchmark datasets. In this paper, we introduce LABR, a Large-scale Arabic Benchmark for Sentiment Analysis. LABR comprises 216,984 Arabic tweets annotated with sentiment labels (positive, negative, and neutral). We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including its characteristics, challenges, and potential applications. We also evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art Arabic sentiment analysis models on LABR, demonstrating the dataset\u2019s effectiveness as a challenging benchmark for Arabic SA. Our results show that there is still significant room for improvement in Arabic SA, and LABR can serve as a valuable resource for researchers in this field."
