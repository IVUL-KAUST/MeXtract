        "Abstract": "We introduce Shamela, a large-scale historical and classical Arabic corpus. The corpus is compiled from the Al-Shamela library, the largest digital collection of Arabic books. The corpus contains over 6 billion words, spanning a period of 1400 years. We describe the compilation and pre-processing of the corpus. We also provide train, development, and test splits for language modeling. We release the corpus in its raw and tokenized formats. The corpus is publicly available at: https://camel.abuduweish.com/shamela/. We believe that the corpus will be a valuable resource for the Arabic NLP community, especially for building language models, word embeddings, and other NLP models for historical and classical Arabic."
