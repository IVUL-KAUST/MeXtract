        "Abstract": "We introduce KaoKore, a dataset of facial expressions from pre-modern Japanese art. The dataset consists of 8,091 cropped face images from 3,606 figures in 963 paintings. The paintings are part of the public domain and are available at four digital archives in Japan. The faces in the paintings were manually cropped by the authors. The facial expressions were annotated by crowd-sourcing with seven labels based on the basic emotions (neutral, happy, sad, disgust, surprise, fear, and anger). In addition to the facial expression labels, we also provide annotations for gender (male, female, androgynous), social status (noble, warrior, clergy, commoner), and age (child, young, middle-aged, old). We believe that our dataset will be useful for researchers in computer vision, digital humanities, and art history. The dataset is available at https://github.com/rois-codh/kaokore."
