        "Abstract": "This paper introduces Alloprof, a new French question-answer dataset in the education domain. The dataset was curated by Alloprof, a Quebec-based organization that offers homework help services to students. It contains over 6,000 question-answer pairs, covering a wide range of subjects, such as mathematics, French, and science. We describe the dataset creation process and provide a baseline for an information retrieval task. We also show that a model pre-trained on this dataset can be used for transfer learning on other French question-answering datasets. The dataset is publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub."
