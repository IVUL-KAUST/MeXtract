        "Abstract": "The medical domain has seen a surge in the development of language models, but progress has been slow for non-English languages due to the scarcity of specialized datasets. To address this gap, we introduce FrenchMedMCQA, the first French Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset for the medical domain. The dataset is created by translating a combination of two existing English medical QA datasets, MedMCQA and MMLU medical subjects, using a combination of machine and human translation. FrenchMedMCQA contains over 104k questions, covering a wide range of medical subjects and topics. We evaluate the performance of several multilingual and French-based language models on the dataset, including a new French medical language model that we pre-trained from scratch, named DrBERT-fr. Our results show that even the best-performing models struggle with the dataset, with the highest accuracy of 52.1% achieved by DrBERT-fr, indicating that there is significant room for improvement. We believe that FrenchMedMCQA will be a valuable resource for the research community to develop and evaluate language models for the medical domain in French. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/abderrahim-oulahna/FrenchMedMCQA."
