The dataset consists of 3,550 questions, SPARQL queries, and answers, as well as 1,493 question paraphrases. The questions were generated automatically from Wikidata and then paraphrased by volunteers. We provide a detailed description of the dataset creation process and the dataset statistics. We also report the results of several QA baselines on our dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/hsedt/rubq."
