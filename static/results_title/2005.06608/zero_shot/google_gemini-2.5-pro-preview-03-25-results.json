        "Abstract": "We define the new category of 'dangerous speech' (DS), language that can increase the risk of violence by a group against another group. We create a lexicon of dangerous speech terms from a variety of sources and use it to create a new dataset of 2,972 documents from a white supremacist forum and a mainstream news source, which we label for DS. We find that our lexicon is a good indicator of DS, and that we can classify documents for DS with an accuracy of .78 using lexicon features. We make our lexicon and dataset freely available."
