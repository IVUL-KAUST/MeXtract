        "Abstract": "Reasoning-intensive retrieval requires systems to synthesize information from multiple sources to answer complex questions. Existing benchmarks often rely on simplified or synthetic data, lacking the realism of real-world information seeking. We introduce BRIGHT, a new benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval, consisting of 13,782 question-answer pairs. BRIGHT is constructed from complex, real-world web documents and requires multi-hop reasoning to find answers. We evaluate a range of retrieval and reading comprehension models on BRIGHT, and find that current models struggle to achieve strong performance. We also analyze the characteristics of BRIGHT and provide insights into the challenges of reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/allenai/bright."
