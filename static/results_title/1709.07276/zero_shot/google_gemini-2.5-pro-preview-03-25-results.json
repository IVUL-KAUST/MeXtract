        "Abstract": "This paper presents the third Arabic Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB-3) challenge, an open competition for Arabic speech recognition. The MGB-3 challenge is a follow up to the MGB-2 challenge held in 2016. The data used in this challenge was collected from the broadcast television (BTV) streams of Aljazeera, Al-Arabiya, and BBC Arabic channels. The MGB-3 data consists of around 1,200 hours of audio, which is more than six times larger than the MGB-2 data. The data covers a variety of genres such as news, talk shows, and reports. The speech is multi-dialectal Arabic speech, including Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and four major dialects: Levantine (LEV), Gulf (GLF), Egyptian (EGY), and North African (NOR). The challenge addresses three tracks: speech recognition, dialect identification, and speaker identification. In this paper, we describe the data collection and annotation process, and present the baseline systems for the speech recognition track."
