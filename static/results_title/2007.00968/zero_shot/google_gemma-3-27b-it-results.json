        "Abstract": "We introduce PIAF, a new native French Question-Answering dataset. PIAF is based on French Wikipedia and contains 80k question-answer pairs. Questions are generated by humans, and answers are extracted from the corresponding Wikipedia article. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including statistics on question types, answer lengths, and the presence of named entities. We also evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art question answering models on PIAF. Our results show that PIAF is a challenging dataset that requires models to have a good understanding of French language and knowledge. We hope that PIAF will be a valuable resource for the French NLP community."
