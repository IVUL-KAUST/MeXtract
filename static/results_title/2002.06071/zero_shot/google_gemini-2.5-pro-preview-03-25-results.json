        "Abstract": "We present FQuAD, a native French Question Answering Dataset. The dataset consists of 25,000+ questions and more than 60,000 question-answer pairs. It is to date the first and largest French native dataset for extractive question-answering. The dataset was built by translating the SQuAD 1.1 dataset using professional French translators. The translated dataset was then validated and corrected by the authors. We provide a baseline evaluation of the dataset with multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM and show that they achieve good performance on FQuAD. We also show that a CamemBERT model fine-tuned on FQuAD outperforms these multilingual models and establishes a strong baseline for future research. The dataset is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0) and is available at https://github.com/illuin-tech/FQuAD-dataset."
