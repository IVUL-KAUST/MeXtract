        "Abstract": "Understanding emotion is a key step towards more empathetic and human-like artificial intelligence. While emotion is a nuanced and complex phenomenon, most large-scale datasets for emotion analysis are restricted to a small number of basic emotions. In this work, we introduce GoEmotions, a human-annotated dataset of 58k Reddit comments labeled for 27 emotion categories. We show that the fine-grained emotion categories in GoEmotions allow for a more nuanced analysis of the emotional content of text. We demonstrate the value of the dataset by training a neural model that achieves 0.50 macro F1-score, a substantial improvement over a 0.32 baseline. We also show that our model's predictions can be used to analyze the emotional arc of conversations. We open-source the dataset and taxonomy to facilitate research on more nuanced models of emotion."
