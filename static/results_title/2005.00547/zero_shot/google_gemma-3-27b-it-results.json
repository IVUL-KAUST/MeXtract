        "Abstract": "Emotion detection is a core task in natural language processing with applications ranging from customer service to mental health monitoring. Existing datasets for emotion detection typically focus on a small number of basic emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger). However, human emotions are much more nuanced. In this paper, we present GoEmotions, a dataset of 127k Reddit comments annotated with 27 fine-grained emotions. We describe the annotation process, analyze the dataset, and present baseline results on the task of emotion classification. Our results show that fine-grained emotion detection is a challenging task, but that it is possible to achieve reasonable performance with state-of-the-art models."
