        "Abstract": "Text-to-image models have recently achieved unprecedented generation quality, but their performance is still lacking for specific domains and cultures. In this work, we present CRAFT (Cultural Russian-oriented datAset For fine-Tuning), a dataset of 60M high-quality image-text pairs in Russian, and release a series of text-to-image models fine-tuned on this dataset. We have developed a special data processing pipeline to adapt the LAION-5B dataset for the Russian cultural context. The pipeline includes cleaning, translation, and filtering stages. We show that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly improves the quality of generated images for Russian-specific queries and makes the models more robust to the nuances of the Russian language. We release the dataset and the models to the public."
