        "Abstract": "The JAFFE (Japanese Female Facial Expression) dataset is a widely used benchmark for facial expression recognition. However, a recent paper (\u201cExcavating AI\u201d) claims that the dataset is biased and contains inaccurate labels. In this paper, we re-examine the JAFFE dataset and debunk the claims made in \u201cExcavating AI\u201d. We show that the dataset is not as biased as claimed and that the labels are generally accurate. We also provide a more detailed analysis of the dataset and discuss its limitations."
