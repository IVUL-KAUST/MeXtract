The dataset is based on the PARus dataset, which was collected from the news domain and contains more than 3,500 question-paragraph pairs. We describe the process of creating the dataset and provide statistics on it. We also present several baselines, including a fine-tuned BERT-based model, and report their performance on the dataset. The dataset is publicly available."
