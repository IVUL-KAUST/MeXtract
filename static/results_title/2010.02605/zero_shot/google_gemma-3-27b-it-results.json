        "Abstract": "We present DaNetQA, a new Russian language question answering dataset designed for yes/no questions. The dataset consists of 10,000 question-answer pairs based on Russian Wikipedia articles. Questions are formulated in a natural language style and require reasoning about the content of the corresponding article to answer correctly. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including statistics on question length, answer distribution, and the types of reasoning required to answer the questions. We also evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art question answering models on DaNetQA, demonstrating that the dataset presents a challenging benchmark for Russian language question answering."
