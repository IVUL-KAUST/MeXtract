        "Abstract": "Reference resolution is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and resolving expressions that refer to entities. While various datasets have been developed for this task, most of them are limited to single documents, which do not reflect real-world scenarios where references can span across multiple documents. To address this limitation, we introduce J-CRe3, a Japanese conversation dataset for real-world reference resolution. J-CRe3 is constructed from a large-scale crowdsourced dialogue corpus and annotated with coreference relations, including those that cross document boundaries. We also provide a baseline model for the task and report its performance on J-CRe3. Our dataset and baseline model will facilitate research on real-world reference resolution in Japanese."
