        "Abstract": "Evaluating the quality of machine-generated text is a challenging task, especially for morphologically rich languages like Russian. Existing evaluation metrics often fail to capture the nuances of language and may not correlate well with human judgments. To address this issue, we present REPA, a new human-annotated dataset for evaluating text generation and judgment capabilities in Russian. The dataset consists of 1,000 texts from two domains (news and Wikipedia) with generated errors of 11 types, including grammatical, semantic, and discourse-level errors. We use our dataset for two tasks: error detection and error type classification. We show that even large language models struggle with these tasks, highlighting the need for more fine-grained evaluation methods. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub."
