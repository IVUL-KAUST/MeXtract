        "Abstract": "The task of hate speech detection has been mostly addressed for English. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multilingual hate speech detection. We introduce a new dataset of tweets in English and Arabic for this task. We experiment with a number of deep learning models with and without multilingual embeddings. We show that it is possible to build a classifier that can process text from more than one language. We also show that a multilingual model can be used in a zero-shot setting, where it is tested on a language that was not seen during training. Our results show that a multilingual model can be a good starting point for a low-resource language, and that its performance can be improved with a small amount of in-language data."
