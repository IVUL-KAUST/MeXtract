        "Abstract": "This paper introduces RuSemShift, the first manually annotated dataset for lexical semantic change (LSC) in Russian. It features 98 target words, for each of which we provide several sentences from two time-specific subcorpora of the Russian National Corpus (RNC): pre-Soviet (18th-19th centuries) and Soviet (1918-1991). The sentences were annotated for semantic relatedness in a graded way by multiple human judges. The resulting dataset can be used to evaluate both contextualized and type-based LSC models. We present the annotation study, the final dataset, and the results of several state-of-the-art LSC models on RuSemShift. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/juliarodina/rusemshift."
