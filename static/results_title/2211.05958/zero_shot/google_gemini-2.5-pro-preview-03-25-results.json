        "Abstract": "Event extraction has been a long-standing and challenging task in information extraction, which aims to identify structured event information from unstructured texts. Most existing event extraction datasets are either small in scale or limited in language, which hinders the development of large-scale multilingual event extraction systems. To address this issue, we present MINION, a large-scale and diverse dataset for multilingual event detection. We construct MINION by unifying the annotation schema of several existing event extraction datasets and automatically annotating a large news corpus through a teacher-student framework. The resulting dataset contains over 1.2M sentences in English, Chinese, and Arabic, with 65 event types and over 1.3M annotated event mentions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of MINION and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art models on the dataset. Experimental results show that MINION presents a challenging testbed for future research in multilingual event extraction. The dataset, code, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/PlusLabUSC/MINION."
