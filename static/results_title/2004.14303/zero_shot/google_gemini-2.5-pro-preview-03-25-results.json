        "Abstract": "The exponential growth of social media has generated a massive amount of user-generated content in the form of opinions, reviews, and comments. This content is a valuable resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. However, most of this content is written in dialects, which are often low-resource languages. In this paper, we present TUNIZI, a new sentiment analysis dataset of 70k Tunisian comments. Tunisian is one of the Arabic dialects. The dataset was collected from Facebook and manually annotated into positive and negative classes. We describe the data collection and the annotation process. We also provide a sentiment lexicon of 3k Tunisian words. Furthermore, we run several experiments using different machine learning and deep learning models to build a baseline for Tunisian sentiment analysis. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes on GitHub: https://github.com/fbougares/TUNIZI."
