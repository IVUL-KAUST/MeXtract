        "Abstract": "We introduce JDocQA, a new Japanese document question answering (QA) dataset for generative language models. JDocQA consists of 13,775 question-answer pairs based on 1,000 Japanese documents. The documents are extracted from Japanese literature, covering a wide range of topics. The questions are designed to require reasoning and understanding of the document content, and the answers are generated by humans. We evaluate several state-of-the-art generative language models on JDocQA and show that they achieve reasonable performance. We also analyze the characteristics of JDocQA and discuss its potential applications."
