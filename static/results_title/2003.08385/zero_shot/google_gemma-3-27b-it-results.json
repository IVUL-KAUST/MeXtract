        "Abstract": "Stance detection aims to identify the attitude expressed in a text towards a given target. Most existing datasets focus on English and single-target scenarios. In this work, we present X-Stance, a multilingual and multi-target stance detection dataset. X-Stance contains tweets in English, Spanish, and Arabic, annotated with respect to different targets related to controversial topics. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including inter-annotator agreement and linguistic characteristics. We also evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art models on X-Stance, showing that multilingual models outperform monolingual models. Finally, we release the dataset to the research community to foster the development of more robust and generalizable stance detection systems."
