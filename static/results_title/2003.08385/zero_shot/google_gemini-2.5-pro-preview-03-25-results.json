        "Abstract": "Stance detection is the task of classifying the author's stance towards a target entity. Most existing datasets are monolingual (English), cover a small number of targets, and are not publicly available. We introduce X-Stance, a new multilingual, multi-target dataset for stance detection. The dataset contains over 150 new topics in German, French, and Italian, and we translate a popular English stance detection dataset into these three languages. In total, the dataset contains over 67k comments. We carefully designed the annotation task to be scalable to a large number of targets and languages. The dataset is publicly available. We provide an extensive analysis of the dataset and benchmark several strong baselines, including a new multilingual BERT-based model. Our experiments show that our new dataset is challenging for monolingual and multilingual models. We also show that multilingual models outperform monolingual models in a zero-shot setting, but that there is still a large gap to the supervised setting."
