        "Abstract": "We present a large-scale historical Arabic corpus, spanning from the 8th to the 19th centuries, comprising approximately 14 million tokens. The corpus is constructed from a diverse collection of digitized Arabic books, covering various genres and disciplines. We describe the corpus creation process, including data acquisition, preprocessing, and annotation. We also present preliminary analyses of the corpus, focusing on lexical and syntactic changes over time. The corpus is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers in computational linguistics, historical linguistics, and Arabic language studies. We release the corpus and associated tools to the research community."
