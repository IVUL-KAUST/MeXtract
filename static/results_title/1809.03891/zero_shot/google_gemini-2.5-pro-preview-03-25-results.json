        "Abstract": "This paper introduces the KITAB corpus, a large-scale historical corpus of classical Arabic. The corpus is designed to enable new kinds of research into the Arabic-speaking world of the first millennium of Islam, and to provide data for the development of new language technology for historical Arabic. The corpus is built on the OpenITI corpus, a machine-readable corpus of classical Arabic texts that is being built by a team of researchers at the Aga Khan University and Leipzig University. The current version of the corpus (version 1) contains more than 4,200 texts and over 900 million words. The paper describes the corpus and the methods that are being used to build it. It also discusses some of the challenges that are involved in working with historical Arabic texts, and the ways in which the KITAB project is addressing these challenges. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential applications of the corpus, and the ways in which it can be used to advance our understanding of the history of the Arabic language and the Arabic-speaking world. The corpus is available for research purposes from the KITAB project website: http://kitab-project.org/."
