        "Abstract": "We present a new dataset of 1,000 multiple choice science questions. The questions are designed to require reasoning and are not easily answered by simple keyword matching. We crowdsourced the questions and answers, and we provide a baseline model that achieves 42% accuracy on the dataset. We also analyze the types of reasoning skills required to answer the questions."
