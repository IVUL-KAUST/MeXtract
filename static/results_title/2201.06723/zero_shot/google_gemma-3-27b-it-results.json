        "Abstract": "Detecting offensive language and hate speech in Arabic social media is a challenging task due to the lack of labeled data and the complex linguistic characteristics of the Arabic language. In this paper, we present a new dataset of Arabic tweets labeled for offensive language and hate speech. We also investigate the use of emojis as anchors to improve the detection performance. Our results show that incorporating emoji information significantly improves the accuracy of offensive language and hate speech detection models. We release the dataset and the code to facilitate future research in this area."
