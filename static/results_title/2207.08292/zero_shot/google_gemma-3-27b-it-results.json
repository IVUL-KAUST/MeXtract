        "Abstract": "Drug prescription is a critical task in healthcare, and accurate understanding of spoken prescriptions is essential for efficient and safe medication dispensing. However, the lack of publicly available datasets hinders the development of robust spoken language understanding (SLU) systems for this domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset of spoken drug prescriptions in French, comprising 1180 utterances collected from real-world pharmacy scenarios. The dataset is annotated with detailed semantic information, including drug names, dosages, frequencies, and routes of administration. We present a baseline SLU system based on a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for semantic slot filling. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of building accurate SLU systems for spoken drug prescriptions in French. The dataset is publicly available to facilitate further research in this important area."
