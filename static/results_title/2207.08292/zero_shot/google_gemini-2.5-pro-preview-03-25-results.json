        "Abstract": "Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a key component of task-oriented dialogue systems. It aims at extracting the intent and the arguments of a user's request. While a lot of research has been conducted on this topic for English, other languages such as French have been less studied, partly due to the lack of public datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for SLU in French. The data is synthetically generated using a context-free grammar that we designed to cover a wide range of plausible drug prescriptions. The final dataset is composed of 100k audio recordings along with their transcriptions and annotations. It is split into train, validation and test sets. We also present a baseline model for intent detection and slot filling that we use to assess the difficulty of the task. The dataset is freely available on the SLURP website, and is one of the first public datasets for SLU in French."
