        "Abstract": "The performance of Question Answering models has improved significantly in recent years with the release of large-scale datasets, especially in English. For French, existing datasets are either machine-translated or too small to train deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce FQuAD, a native French Question Answering dataset. The dataset contains 60,000+ question-answer pairs. In the spirit of SQuAD2.0, the dataset also contains unanswerable questions. The questions were written by crowd-workers on a set of Wikipedia articles. We report the performance of several models, including multilingual and French models. The best model reaches an F1 score of 88.0% and an EM score of 80.5% on the FQuAD development set. The dataset is made freely available to accelerate French NLP research."
