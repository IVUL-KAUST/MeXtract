        "Abstract": "We present RELX, a new dataset for cross-lingual relation classification, and MMLB, a simple and effective baseline. RELX is automatically created by aligning relations in the English Wikidata knowledge base with Wikipedia articles in five languages: English (EN), German (DE), Spanish (ES), French (FR) and Chinese (ZH). It contains over 1.2M sentences. We use a state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedder to embed sentences from all languages in a single vector space. We then train a single classifier on the union of the EN training data and a small number of training examples from the other four languages. This simple baseline, Matching the Multilingual Blanks (MMLB), is effective. It outperforms a competitive baseline by 10 F1 points on average. We also show that MMLB is competitive with zero-shot cross-lingual transfer models while using as few as eight training examples in the target language."
