        "Abstract": "Word Sense Induction (WSI) is the task of unsupervised clustering of word usages. WSI is a powerful tool for lexicographers and NLP researchers, but there are few WSI datasets for languages other than English. In this paper, we present RuDSI, a new large-scale dataset for Russian WSI. The dataset was created with a graph-based approach and contains 102 ambiguous Russian words, including 24 verbs, 75 nouns, and 3 adjectives. For each ambiguous word, the dataset provides a set of contexts, illustrating its different meanings. Each context is manually annotated with a sense from the Russian dictionary. RuDSI is publicly available at https://github.com/airi-institute/RuDSI."
