        "Abstract": "We introduce LAMBADA, a new dataset for evaluating language models. LAMBADA consists of sentences extracted from books, each ending with a masked word that needs to be predicted given the preceding context. Unlike existing language modeling datasets, LAMBADA requires a broad discourse context to perform well, as the masked word often depends on information from many sentences before. We evaluate several state-of-the-art language models on LAMBADA and find that they perform significantly worse than on other language modeling datasets. This suggests that LAMBADA is a challenging new benchmark for evaluating language models\u2019 ability to capture long-range dependencies."
