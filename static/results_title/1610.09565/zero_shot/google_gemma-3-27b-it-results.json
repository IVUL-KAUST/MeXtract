        "Abstract": "Arabic transliteration, the task of converting Arabic text into its Latin representation, is a crucial step in many NLP applications. In this paper, we investigate the use of sequence-to-sequence neural network models for Arabic transliteration. We experiment with different model architectures, including LSTM and Transformer networks, and evaluate their performance on a newly created dataset of Arabic-Latin transliteration pairs. Our results show that Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task, outperforming LSTM models by a significant margin."
