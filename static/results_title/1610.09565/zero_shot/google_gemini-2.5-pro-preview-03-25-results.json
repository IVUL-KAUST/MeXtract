        "Abstract": "Transliteration is the task of converting a text from one script to another based on phonetic equivalence. It is a crucial task for many downstream applications such as machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a sequence-to-sequence model for the task of transliteration. We experiment with different types of recurrent neural network (RNN) based models (unidirectional, bidirectional, and multi-layered) with attention mechanism. We evaluate our models on the Arabic-English and English-Arabic transliteration tasks using the NEWS 2016 shared task datasets. Our experimental results show that our models outperform the state-of-the-art systems on both tasks. We also show that our models are robust to the noisy nature of the data."
