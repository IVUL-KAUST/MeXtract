        "Abstract": "We present Golos, a Russian speech dataset. The dataset is collected from a crowdsourcing platform. The total duration of the collected audio is over 1200 hours, of which 1053 hours are manually annotated and verified. The dataset contains recordings from different acoustic conditions and environments. All recordings were manually transcribed by professional annotators. We also provide a 100-hour subset of Golos with clean recordings for a quick model training and evaluation. We have trained and evaluated several state-of-the-art acoustic models to provide a baseline for the dataset. The dataset is publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license."
