        "Abstract": "Math word problems require both reasoning and arithmetic skills. Current approaches typically train large language models to directly output answers, but this can be unreliable. We propose training a verifier model to check the correctness of candidate answers. We find that verifiers can significantly improve performance on math word problems, even when trained on a relatively small dataset. Our verifiers are also more robust to adversarial examples than direct answer prediction models. We release a new dataset of 100k math word problems with four answer choices, designed to be challenging for both humans and machines."
