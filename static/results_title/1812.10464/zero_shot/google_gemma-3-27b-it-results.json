        "Abstract": "Cross-lingual transfer is a fundamental capability for natural language processing, enabling models to generalize to new languages without requiring labeled data. Sentence embeddings play a crucial role in cross-lingual transfer, as they represent sentences in a shared vector space. However, existing sentence embedding methods often struggle to achieve strong performance on cross-lingual tasks, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce LaSOT, a massively multilingual sentence embedding dataset for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer and beyond. LaSOT contains 105k sentences in 107 languages, covering a wide range of domains and styles. We train a multilingual sentence embedding model on LaSOT and demonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of cross-lingual tasks, including cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results show that LaSOT significantly improves the performance of cross-lingual transfer, especially for low-resource languages. We also analyze the properties of LaSOT and provide insights into the challenges and opportunities of cross-lingual transfer."
