        "Abstract": "We present NEREL, a new dataset for Russian language with nested named entities, relations, and events. The data is based on news texts from a large Russian news agency. The dataset contains 938 news texts (about 14,500 sentences, 250,000 tokens) annotated manually. The annotation scheme includes 3 entity types (Person, Location, Organization), 13 relations between them, and 3 event types with 33 arguments. The dataset is the first in Russian to feature nested entities, events, and a large number of n-ary relations. We provide a train/dev/test split and baselines for named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction. The dataset is available at https://github.com/nerel-ds/NEREL."
