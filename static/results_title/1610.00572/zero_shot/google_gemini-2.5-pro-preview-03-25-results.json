        "Abstract": "We present a new parallel corpus of Arabic-Hebrew, two Semitic languages with complex morphology. The corpus is based on TED and TEDx talks, a collection of presentations on a variety of subjects. The Arabic side is transcribed in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), while the Hebrew side is in Modern Hebrew. The corpus contains more than 100k sentence pairs and more than 2M tokens on the Arabic side and 1.8M tokens on the Hebrew side. We describe the corpus collection and processing, and provide a quantitative analysis of the corpus. We also report baseline machine translation results on this corpus, which we make publicly available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available parallel corpus for this language pair, and we hope it will be a useful resource for machine translation and other cross-lingual NLP tasks involving Arabic and Hebrew."
