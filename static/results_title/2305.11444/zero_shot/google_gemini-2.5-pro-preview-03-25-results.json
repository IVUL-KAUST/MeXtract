        "Abstract": "We present the Arukikata Travelogue Dataset, a new, freely available Japanese-English parallel corpus of travel conversations. The corpus was created from a single-author travelogue series, Chikyu no Arukikata (Globe-Trotter Travel Guidebook), which has been published for 40 years. The corpus contains approximately 1.1 million sentence pairs from 122 books. We also provide a document-aligned test set for evaluating document-level machine translation. We conducted a baseline experiment on the corpus and found that it is a useful resource for training and evaluating machine translation systems. The corpus is available at http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/aru."
