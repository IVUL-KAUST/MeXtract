        "Abstract": "Recent progress in NLP has been driven by benchmarks that have grown in complexity from single sentence classification (SST) to sentence-pair regression (STS) and passage-level question answering (SQuAD, etc.). A parallel trend has been the development of multilingual benchmarks (XNLI, etc.) that have enabled the development of cross-lingual models. However, these benchmarks have been limited to sentence-level tasks, which has limited the development of cross-lingual models for document-level tasks. To address this gap, we create a corpus of Amazon reviews in six languages (English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, and Chinese) and select a balanced subset of reviews for a document-level sentiment analysis task. We show that a multilingual BERT model fine-tuned on the English training data performs well on the other languages, and that performance can be improved by fine-tuning on the multilingual training data. We release this new corpus to the public."
