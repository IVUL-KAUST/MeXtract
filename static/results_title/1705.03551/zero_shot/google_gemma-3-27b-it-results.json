        "Abstract": "We introduce TriviaQA, a large-scale reading comprehension dataset distantly supervised from trivia questions and answers. TriviaQA contains 95K question-answer pairs, each with supporting documents retrieved from the web. The questions require reasoning over multiple sentences and documents to find the answer. We present a novel evaluation metric, Exact Match (EM), that measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth answer spans. We also present results on a set of strong baseline models, including a bidirectional attention flow network and a memory network. Our results show that TriviaQA is a challenging dataset for existing reading comprehension models."
