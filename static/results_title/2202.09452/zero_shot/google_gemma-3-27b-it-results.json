        "Abstract": "Early Modern French (EMF) is a historical period of the French language that spans from the 16th to the 18th century. It is a crucial period for understanding the evolution of the French language, but it is also a challenging period for NLP due to the lack of resources. In this paper, we present FreEM, a large corpus of EMF texts, and D\u2019AlemBERT, a language model trained on FreEM. FreEM contains 15.9M tokens from 533 books published between 1532 and 1799. We evaluate D\u2019AlemBERT on a variety of downstream tasks, including masked language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Our results show that D\u2019AlemBERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on these tasks. We also show that FreEM and D\u2019AlemBERT can be used to generate realistic EMF texts."
