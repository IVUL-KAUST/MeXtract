        "Abstract": "This paper introduces two new resources for Early Modern French (1500-1789). First, we introduce FreEM, a 2.6 billion-word corpus of Early Modern French gathered from various online sources (Google Books, Gallica, the Biblioth\u00e8que de Gen\u00e8ve, etc.). The selection of the texts was made manually by specialists of the period. The corpus is supplied with rich metadata (author, title, date, publisher, etc.). We also provide D'AlemBERT, a language model for Early Modern French, which was pre-trained on the FreEM corpus. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: part-of-speech tagging and masked language modeling. We show that D'AlemBERT outperforms other models for Early Modern French, such as CamemBERT or other multilingual models. The corpus and the model are freely available on the Hugging Face Hub."
