        "Abstract": "This paper describes the construction of a Japanese word similarity dataset. Word similarity is a valuable resource for various natural language processing tasks and for the evaluation of distributed word representations. While a number of word similarity datasets have been created for English, there are only a few for other languages, including Japanese. We created a new Japanese word similarity dataset using crowdsourcing. The dataset consists of 1,108 word pairs, and the similarity scores were annotated by 10 crowdworkers. We evaluated the dataset by using it as a benchmark for several word similarity measures. The experimental results show that our dataset is reliable and of a higher quality than existing datasets."
