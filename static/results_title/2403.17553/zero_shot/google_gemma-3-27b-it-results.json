        "Abstract": "Bias in language models is a growing concern, particularly in low-resource languages like Russian. Existing bias detection datasets are often limited in size or scope, making it difficult to develop robust bias mitigation techniques. In this paper, we present RuBia, a new Russian language bias detection dataset consisting of 10,000 social media posts annotated for different types of bias, including toxicity, stereotypes, and hate speech. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including the distribution of different bias types and the inter-annotator agreement. We also evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art bias detection models on RuBia, demonstrating that they struggle to generalize to Russian. We hope that RuBia will serve as a valuable resource for researchers working on bias detection and mitigation in Russian and other low-resource languages."
