        "Abstract": "We introduce the Japanese-English Subtitle Corpus (JESC), a large-scale parallel corpus of Japanese and English subtitles. The corpus was built from scratch by crawling and aligning subtitles from a large variety of TV shows, resulting in 2.8 million high-quality sentence pairs. We describe the collection process, which is based on a novel method for aligning subtitles based on time-stamps and content-based features. We also present a number of baseline neural and phrase-based machine translation systems to demonstrate the usefulness of this new resource, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest freely available parallel corpus for Japanese and English."
