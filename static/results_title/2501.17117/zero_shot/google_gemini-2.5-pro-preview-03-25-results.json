        "Abstract": "We introduce Histoires Morales, a new dataset for assessing the moral alignment of language models (LMs) in French. Inspired by the English ETHICS dataset, Histoires Morales contains 102k short stories generated by a large language model (LLM) and covering a wide range of scenarios, from everyday situations to more complex ethical dilemmas. Each story is paired with human annotations of moral judgments based on a comprehensive taxonomy of moral theories. We also provide a test set of 1k manually translated and reviewed instances from the ETHICS dataset to ensure a high-quality evaluation. We use our dataset to evaluate several multilingual and French language models on their moral alignment, and find that even the best-performing models struggle to consistently make sound moral judgments. Our results highlight the need for more research on developing morally aligned LMs, especially for languages other than English. The dataset is made publicly available."
