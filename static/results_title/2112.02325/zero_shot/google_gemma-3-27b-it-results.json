        "Abstract": "We present a new dataset for question answering (QA) systems based on the Russian version of the Jeopardy! game show. The dataset consists of 1000 question-answer pairs, manually curated from the publicly available game episodes. The questions cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, making it a challenging benchmark for evaluating the performance of QA models. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, including statistics on question length, answer length, and topic distribution. We also present baseline results on the dataset using several state-of-the-art QA models. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes."
