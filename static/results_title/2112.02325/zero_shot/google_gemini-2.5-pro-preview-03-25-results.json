        "Abstract": "This paper presents a new large-scale Russian data set for the evaluation of question-answering systems. The data set is based on questions from the Russian version of the TV show Jeopardy!, called Svoya Igra. The current version of the data set contains 210,522 question-answer pairs. We provide a predefined split of the data set into training, development, and test sets. The data set is freely available for research purposes. We present a baseline system for factoid question answering based on a search engine. The system achieves the precision at 1 (P@1) of 39.8% on the presented data set. We hope that this data set will foster research in the area of Russian question answering."
