        "Abstract": "Recent work by Zellers et al. (2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural language inference: given an event description such as 'A woman sits at a piano,' a machine must select the most likely followup: 'She sets her fingers on the keys.' With the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), near human-level performance was reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans (\u00a1 95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (\u00a1 48%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models."
