        "Abstract": "Multilingual question answering tasks typically assume that answers exist in the same language as the question. Yet in practice, many languages face both information scarcity -where languages have few reference articles-and information asymmetry -where questions reference concepts from other cultures. This work extends open-retrieval question answering to a cross-lingual setting enabling questions from one language to be answered via answer content from another language. We construct a large-scale dataset built on 40K information-seeking questions across 7 diverse non-English languages that TYDI QA could not find same-language answers for. Based on this dataset, we introduce a task framework, called Cross -lingual O penR etrieval Q uestion A nswering ( XOR QA ), that consists of three new tasks involving crosslingual document retrieval from multilingual and English resources. We establish baselines with state-of-the-art machine translation systems and cross-lingual pretrained models. Experimental results suggest that XOR QA is a challenging task that will facilitate the development of novel techniques for multilingual question answering.
