        "Abstract": "This study presents AraSpider, the first Arabic version of the Spider dataset, aimed at improving natural language  processing  (NLP)  in  the  Arabic-speaking  community. Four  multilingual translation models were tested for their effectiveness in translating English to Arabic. Additionally, two models were assessed for their ability to generate SQL queries from Arabic text. The results showed that using back translation significantly improved the performance of both ChatGPT 3.5 and  SQLCoder  models,  which  are  considered  top  performers  on  the  Spider  dataset.  Notably, ChatGPT  3.5  demonstrated  high-quality  translation,  while  SQLCoder  excelled  in  text-to-SQL tasks. The study underscores the importance of incorporating contextual schema and employing back translation  strategies  to  enhance  model  performance  in  Arabic  NLP  tasks.  Moreover,  the provision of detailed methodologies for reproducibility and translation of the dataset into other languages  highlights  the  research's  commitment  to  promoting  transparency  and  collaborative knowledge  sharing  in  the  field.  Overall,  these  contributions  advance  NLP  research,  empower Arabic-speaking  researchers,  and  enrich  the  global  discourse  on  language  comprehension  and database interrogation."
