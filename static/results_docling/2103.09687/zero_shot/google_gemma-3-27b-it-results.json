        "Abstract": "Darija Open Dataset (DODa) is an open-source project for the Moroccan dialect.  With  more  than  10,000  entries  DODa  is  arguably  the  largest  open-source collaborative  project  for  Darija \u21c6 English  translation  built  for  Natural  Language Processing  purposes.  In  fact,  besides  semantic  categorization,  DODa  also  adopts  a syntactic  one,  presents  words  under  different  spellings,  offers  verb-to-noun  and masculine-to-feminine correspondences, contains the conjugation of hundreds of verbs in different tenses, and many other subsets to help researchers better understand and study Moroccan dialect. This data paper presents a description of DODa, its features, how  it  was  collected,  as  well  as  a  first  application  in  Image  Classification  using ImageNet labels translated to Darija. This collaborative project is hosted on GitHub platform  under  MIT's  Open-Source  license  and  aims  to  be  a  standard  resource  for researchers, students, and anyone who is interested in Moroccan Dialect."
