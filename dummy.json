    "Abstract": "Instruction tuning has emerged as a prominent methodology for teaching Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions.\nHowever, current instruction datasets predominantly cater to English or are derived from\nEnglish-dominated LLMs, resulting in inherent\nbiases toward Western culture. This bias significantly impacts the linguistic structures of\nnon-English languages such as Arabic, which\nhas a distinct grammar reflective of the diverse cultures across the Arab region. This\npaper addresses this limitation by introducing CIDAR1\nthe first open Arabic instructiontuning dataset culturally-aligned by human reviewers. CIDAR contains 10,000 instruction\nand output pairs that represent the Arab region. We discuss the cultural relevance of\nCIDAR via the analysis and comparison to other\nmodels fine-tuned on other datasets. Our experiments show that CIDAR can help enrich\nresearch efforts in aligning LLMs with the\nArabic culture. All the code is avail",
