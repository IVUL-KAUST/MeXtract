# Guidelines for Model Schema
In this task we want to extract models' metadata from papers. Here is a discribtion of the mdatadata:

1. **Name**: Name of the model family
2. **Num_Parameters**: the number of parameters of the largest model, if there are multiple models in the paper, choose the biggest one, mostly chat version
3. **Unit**: the unit of the number of parameters
4. **Type**: the type of the model
5. **Think**: whether the model is a thinking/ reasoning model or not
6. **Version**: the version of the model
7. **Models**: all model variants listed in the paper
8. **License**: the license of the model
9. **Year**: the year of the model was published
10. **Benchmarks**: the evaluation benchmarks of the model
11. **Architecture**: the architecture of the model
12. **Context**: the context size of the model
13. **Language**: the language of the model was pretrained on
14. **Provider**: which company or organization provided the model
15. **Modality**: the modality of the model
16. **Paper_Link**: the link to the paper
